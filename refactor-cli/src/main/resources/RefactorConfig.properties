Use **only ASCII quotes** (no curly quotes) and ensure it can be parsed by JavaParser.\n4) Do **not** wrap code in triple backticks, do not use enumerations or bullet points. Just provide the final `.java` source.\n5) Provide the updated aggregator classes, repository classes, or saga classes as needed, referencing our DDD framework rules.\n\nFinally, output only that JSON?nothing else.\n\n=== CODE CHUNK ===\n
